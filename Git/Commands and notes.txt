//Files tracked by Git can be in one of three stages
- Committed | Unmodified changes from last commit snapshot
- Modified  | Changes made to the file since last commit snapshot
- Staged    | Changes marked to be added into the next commit snapshot

//Git objects
- Blobs
- Trees              | Directories
- Commits
- Annotated Tags     | A tag points to a object/commit
