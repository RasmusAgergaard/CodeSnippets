    /********** Strings, numbers and booleans - Are value types **********/
    let number1 = 10;
    let number2 = number1;
    console.log(number1, number2);        //Outout: 10 10
    number1 = 20;
    console.log(number1, number2);        //Outout: 20 10



    /********** Aarray - Are reference types **********/
    let players1 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    let players2 = players1;
    console.log(players1, players2);      //Output: ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"], ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]

    //If we change one, we change both as the one just reference the other one
    players2[3] = "Bob";
    console.log(players1, players2);      //Output: ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Bob"],Â ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Bob"]

    //You can make a non reference copy like this
    let players3 = players1.slice();
    let players4 = [].concat(players1); //Create a new array and concat the old one in
    let players5 = [...players1]; //The new ES6 Spread
    let players6 = Array.from(players1);



    /********** Objects - Also reference types **********/

    // with Objects
    const person1 = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    //You can make a copy like this
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person1, {age: 40});
    console.log( person2); //Output: {name: "Wes Bos", age: 40}

    //NOTE: assign only goes one level deep, so a sub object is still a reference. So you need a special function if you need to copy a object with many layers
